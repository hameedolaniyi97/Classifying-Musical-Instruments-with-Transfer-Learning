Musical Instrument Classification with Transfer Learning
Project Overview

This project applies deep learning with transfer learning (EfficientNet-B3) to classify 10 different musical instruments from images. The goal was to build a reliable classifier that can distinguish between visually similar instruments (e.g., banjo vs. guitar) with high accuracy.
